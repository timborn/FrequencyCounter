# FrequencyCounter
Arduino Frequency Counter proof of concept

If you stick a 555 circuit on (Arduino) pin 5 and run this sketch,
you should see the serial display recording the measured frequency.
If you get that far, your system works, and you can think about
using this frequency code elsewhere (like building your own LC meter).
